# Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to predict bankruptcy using various machine learning methodologies. The project involves data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Introduction

This notebook aims to predict the likelihood of a company encountering financial insolvency by leveraging machine learning algorithms on financial data. The dataset contains 95 financial ratios from companies, which are used to predict bankruptcy. The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009.

## Methodology

1. **Importing Libraries and Data**
2. **Checking Data Quality**
3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**
4. **Handling Class Imbalance**
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**
6. **Ensemble Modeling**

## Models Employed

- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Voting Classifier to Ensemble the above models**

## Results

The ensemble classifier demonstrated robust performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a comparative performance overview.
